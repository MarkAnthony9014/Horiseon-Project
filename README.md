# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Refactored code for Horiseon. 

* Moved the header section into the head element. 

* Changed the div to nav, then updated the stylesheet accordingly. 

* Removed the "seo" class to compartmentalize stylesheet. Inserted "style='color:#d9dcd6'" within the span element, then removed the style declarations for ".h1 seo" on the stylesheet. 

* Changed "class" to id before "search engine optimization" to debug the navigation issue. Page now navigates to "Search Engine Optimization" section from the header navigation. 

* Compartmentalized the classess within the benefits section, made a class that applies to all three subsections. 

* Compartmentalized the class for the images in the content section.

* Compartmentalized the class for the content using the class ".content-style"

* Finished refactored code result: https://markanthony9014.github.io/Horiseon-Project/
